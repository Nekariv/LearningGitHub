Before Completing this Step you must try the Exercise "Seconde Step Pushing 1_2"

Now what you have to do:
1- Save this Files
2- Look what Happen Into Github desktop
3-Unknow
4-



After the Exercise
-I learned that it make you commit again
-I learned that it will not force you to Push
-I belive it would then push the 2 Commit exactly like in SVN when you just push several different object.
- A commit is juste a groupe of element that you saved at a certain periode
- A push is a compilation of Commit 


Expectation:(it is probably possible that the Host can decide to revert 1 commit of a push with 2 commit.)
